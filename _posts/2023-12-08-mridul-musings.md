- Unknowingly making mistakes are learning but knowingly making mistake is an act of foolishness.
- Don't be a preacher or someone who gives life advice. Just laugh and be happy.
- Always start with Why, implement the How and the output is what.
- You have to identify why something happened suddenly, why it didn't happen previously.
  - if you realize the x-1 /x/x+1 law you can progress recursively very well.
- My battle is beating the [[mediocrity]]. I haven't challenged myself enough that is where my mind gets thoughts of [[limiting self-beliefs]] and for continuous improvement [[Challenges]] your status quo.

- To make faster progress, implement a feedback mechanism for improvement, remember doing DSA questions on leetcode or hacker rank?

- Don't judge people.
- You become :
  -   what you consume.
  -   whom you are surrounded you. You are an average of 3 people constantly surrounded by.

    -   like Hotstar.

- I am not arrogant or egoist, just quiet or probably zoned out.
- Sometimes, lack of resources can get the best out of you because you will bleed for the book/any and value it forever.
- people who make interests along with the fun and [[joy]]
- there should not be more than a 2-day gap in practicing the habits.
- Every time you are tempted to react in the same old way, ask if you want to be a prisoner of the past or a pioneer of the future.
- Smart people save their asses.
- Motives are really important in life, I promise I will never have any wrong motives while doing any task on my hand.
	- Don't hurt anyone at any cost, it shouldn't be your motive or intent. Always be sorry for your wrong deeds.
- insanity is doing the same thing again and again, and expecting different results.
- Develop an art form.
	- Tech is my art form, I think I am chasing it.
- Curiosity and Implementation >>>> Degree.

- I am what I am because of my patience.
- Things started to become worse when I stopped valuing them. [[Gratitude]]
- If you have a setback and constantly think about it and not on your goals, your [[Mindset]] is fucked up.

- never compromise your [[Mindset]] or [[flow state]] just to entertain people or be likable, you have got greater things to do and achieve in life. Set [[Boundaries]]
	- being valuable >>>> being nice.
- If ever I get setbacks and negative emotions, i need a way to outflow it from my life. [[Running]] helps over here.

	- You can't win the world with hate and those people who spread hate, love 
		- I am never someone who indulges himself in bitching
