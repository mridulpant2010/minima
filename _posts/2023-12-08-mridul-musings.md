- `energy infectious and smile contagious`
- Make efforts to become effortless.
- Unknowingly making mistakes are learning but knowingly making mistake is an act of foolishness.
- Don't be a preacher or someone who gives life advice. Just laugh and be happy.
- Always start with Why, implement the How and the output is what.
- You have to identify why something happened suddenly, why it didn't happen previously.
  - If you realize the x-1 /x/x+1 law you can progress recursively very well.
- My battle is beating the mediocrity. I haven't challenged myself enough that is where my mind gets thoughts of limiting self-beliefs.
- The only wrong thing with the Parkinson's Law is not understanding the concept of intensity.
- Don't take yourself seriously in a world of 150 billion people.
- If highlights are clearer, task completion will be faster.
- If you want to make improvements in certain tasks/items, track them down properly. 
  - Growth ~ numbers, help you in tracking the progress.
- To make faster progress, implement a feedback mechanism for improvement, remember doing DSA questions on leetcode or hacker rank?
- I believe in Identifying the right techniques and the right strategies for any new tasks.
- Don't judge people.
- You become :
  -   what you consume.
  -   whom you are surrounded you. You are an average of 3 people constantly surrounded by.
  -   what you practice
- greed to learn more >>>> work experience.
- I should only cry with happiness.
- I am not arrogant or egoist, just quiet or probably zoned out.
- Sometimes, lack of resources can get the best out of you because you will bleed for the book/resource and value it forever.
- There should not be more than a 2-day gap in practicing the habits.
- Every time you are tempted to react in the same old way, ask if you want to be a prisoner of the past or a pioneer of the future.
- Smart people save their asses.
  - Smart people figure out things faster.
- Insanity is doing the same thing again and again, and expecting different results.
- Develop an art form.
	- Tech is my art form, I am chasing it.
- Curiosity and Implementation >>>> Degree.
- Vital few >>> trivial many
- I am what I am because of my patience.
- Things started to become worse when I stopped valuing them. Gratitude
- If you have a setback and constantly think about it and not on your goals, your Mindset is fucked up.
- Words do have a powerful meaning in the subconscious mind, choose them wisely.
- Never compromise your Mindset or flow state just to entertain people or be likable, you have got greater things to do and achieve in life. Set Boundaries
	- being valuable >>>> being nice.
- If ever I get setbacks and negative emotions, I need a way to outflow it from my life. 
- Running helps over here.
- At any cost spread happiness, no hatred, jealousy, or envy.
	- You can't win the world with hate and those people who spread hate, love is the only cure.
		- I am never someone who indulges himself in bitching.
- Motives are really important in life, I promise I will never have any wrong motives while doing any task on my hand.
	- Don't hurt anyone at any cost, it shouldn't be your motive or intent. Always be sorry for your wrong deeds.
- My parent's sacrifices above anything else, matter a lot to me.
- Weak Concentration leads to a bad Tech Learning experience.
- Rejection and failure are modifiable statistics. The more you face both, the more likely youâ€™ll learn how to minimise them (and reduce your fear of them).
