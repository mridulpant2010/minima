Intelligence can become a curse when it leads to overthinking, anxiety, and a sense of isolation. Highly intelligent individuals may struggle to connect with others who do not share their level of intellectual curiosity and may find themselves constantly analyzing and critiquing their thoughts and actions. Additionally, being highly intelligent can sometimes lead to a sense of responsibility to solve complex problems, which can be overwhelming and lead to burnout. However, it's important to note that intelligence is not inherently a curse, and can be a valuable asset in many situations.
